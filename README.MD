# Database Version Control Module

## Overview
There is a need to store the upgrade history for a given database instance so it can be safely and easily upgraded when a given version of an application or module is deployed.  This Database Version Control Module (VCM) will serve to inform data staff of which database module version is installed on a given database instance and when each database module upgrade was applied to the instance.  This module is used to apply the necessary database upgrades in the correct order to deploy a given database module version for an associated application/module.
