# Database Version Control Module

## Overview
The [Database Version Control Module (VCM)](https://github.com/PIFSC-NMFS-NOAA/PIFSC-DBVersionControlModule) was developed to provide a safe and easy way to install and upgrade database modules deployed on a given Oracle database instance.  The VCM provides information on which database module versions were installed and when they were installed on a database instance.  This module is used to apply the necessary database upgrades in the correct order to upgrade a given database module to a desired version.
