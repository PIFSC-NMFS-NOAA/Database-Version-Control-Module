# [Project Name] - Installing or Upgrading the Database

## Procedure:
 - New installation: If you are installing this module on a database instance for the first time run the [SQL Directory]/[DB File Name Prefix]_combined_DDL_DML.sql script.
 - Upgrading an existing installation: You must first determine which version of the PIFSC Data Set Database is currently installed by querying the DB_UPGRADE_LOGS_V view with the UPGRADE_APP_NAME = '[DB Name]'.  The highest UPGRADE_VERSION value is the currently installed database version (e.g. 0.3).  The scripts ([DB File Name Prefix]_DDL_DML_upgrade_v[MAJOR].[MINOR].sql where [MAJOR] is the major version number and [MINOR] is the minor version number) in the [SQL Directory]/upgrades folder will be run in order to upgrade the database to the desired version.  For instance if the current version of the database is 0.3 and the desired database version is 0.5 the [DB File Name Prefix]_DDL_DML_upgrade_v0.4.sql and [DB File Name Prefix]_DDL_DML_upgrade_v0.5.sql files will be executed on the database instance in that order to perform the upgrade.  
 - **Note: [SQL Directory]/README.txt contains detailed information for the general database version control policies
